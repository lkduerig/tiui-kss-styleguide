# tiui-kss-styleguide

This styleguide was generated with KSS documentation syntax and KSS-node https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node to create a "Living Styleguide". It contains a skeleton with some examples for SMACSS structured stylesheets. 

Other Git repositories under my command that have something about kss or tiui in the names are likely to be some variation of this.
